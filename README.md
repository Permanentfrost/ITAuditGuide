# ITAuditGuide

This aims to be a guide to IT Audit-Best Practices. It is aimed at a company size of SME (Less than 250 people)

Ressources and standards used within:  

-ISA 315 (Revised 2019)

-ISO27001

-NIST CSF 2.0 (Cybersecurity Framework) 

-NIST 800-53 Special Publication 

-NIST 800-63 Special Publication 

## General Process

Before you jump right into the audit with the checklist, there are some key-things you need to be aware of. I'll try to list these below together with a rough outline of the audit timeline: From Start -> Finish. 

### Audit Planning
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly define what will be covered in the audit, including systems, processes, and locations.
- **Objective Setting**: Outline the audit's objectives, which could include assessing risks, evaluating controls, or verifying compliance.
- **Resource Allocation**: Determine the resources needed, including team members, tools, time, and most important budget available. 
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential risks that could impact the audit process.

### Execution of the Audit
- **Data Collection**: Gather evidence through interviews, observations, screenshots and document reviews.
- **Testing**: Perform tests on IT controls to assess their effectiveness (Keywords: ITGC, ITAC).
- **Analysis**: Analyze the data collected to identify any issues or areas for improvement.

### Reporting
- **Findings**: Document the audit findings, including any weaknesses or non-compliance issues.
- **Recommendations**: Provide recommendations for addressing the findings.
- **Action Plan**: Develop an action plan with timelines for implementing the recommendations.

### Follow-Up
- **Implementation Review**: Check whether the recommendations have been implemented effectively.
- **Post-Implementation Audit**: If possible/necessaty conduct a follow-up audit to ensure that the changes have resulted in the desired improvements.

### Continuous Improvement
- **Feedback Loop**: Establish a mechanism for ongoing feedback and continuous improvement of the audit process.
- **Update Audit Procedures**: Regularly update the audit procedures to reflect changes in technology, regulations, and business processes -> IT-moves at lightspeed ;).


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Never underestimate good Audit Planning! Always keep in regular contact with the Lead-Auditor for important information.  

As such the rough timeline can be descriped as: 

```
1. Kick-off internal (Audit Lead and IT-Auditor) 
2. Kick off external (IT Auditor and client)
3. Audit Process and Document Review
4. Finalize and communicate results to client / review possibility 
5. Finalize and communicate results to Audit Lead
```
